# theMike97 Project

Bootloader project from theMike97 written in x86 assembly. As implied, assembly language knowledge is required here; CMPE 102 at SJSU (or any school's x86 assembly course would help here). The files in this project are as listed:

* makefile - Easier means of compilation and running without having to type in the same commands for debugging
* main.asm - Driver code
