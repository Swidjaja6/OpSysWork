Operating System Project taken up under the sponsorship of San Jose State University's Society of Computer and Software Engineers. This respository will serve as a ground for placing mini-projects that are found online to aid in the final goal of creating a small Operating System. This will be the main repository of this project until a new one is created at a later date (soon) to first learn how to create an OS and how to make its components, and then this will serve as a side repository for mini-projects found on the internet.
