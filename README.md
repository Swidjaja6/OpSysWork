Operating System Project taken up under the sponsorship of San Jose State University's Society of Computer and Software Engineers. This respository will serve as a ground for placing mini-projects that are found online to aid in the final goal of creating a small Operating System. This will be the main repository of this project until a new one is created at a later date (soon) to first learn how to create an OS and how to make its components, and then this will serve as a side repository for mini-projects found on the internet.

### List of Miniprojects

## Project Guidelines
This project is not like other projects taken in a normal university. Creating an Operating System is a very difficult task and will require extensive research. However, there are a variety of classes that help with knowing how an OS functions. 

### Classes Recommended
This list dictates what classes at SJSU (and potentially other schools) aid with knowledge on Operating Systems and other computer hardware related componets that an OS uses to function:

* Assembly Language Programming (CMPE 102)
* Computer Organization and Architecture (CMPE 120)
* Computer Architecture and Design (CMPE 140)
* Operating Systems Design (CMPE 142)
* Introduction to Computer Systems (CS 47)
* Computer Architecture (CS 147)
* Operating Systems (CS 149)

## Current Task
The current task being undertaken is to create a bootloader using UEFI. I have replicated the project from theMike97 (See above) in the Youtube tutorial series. It is entirely in x86 Assembly and a good place to start.
